# concat is a community of technologists based in the Pacific NorthWest

The word concat comes from `concatenate`, a term in programming used when chaining things from end to end.  In the scope of community, we use the idea to symbolize bringing people together and creating connections.

Knowing that often the culture around development is overly homogenous, our core ideals are based around lifting one another up and creating opportunity, especially for folks who are otherwise left behind.

## All tech-workers welcome:

Anyone working in (or aspiring to work in) tech is welcome here. Our only hard and fast rule is that everyone abide by the code of conduct and treat others the way they’d like to be treated.

We welcome content creators, contributors and other collaborators. You don’t have to be an engineer though! In our earliest days this group was targeted toward front-end developers (people who primarily make websites). With time, we found folks outside of that definition who also wanted to participate, folks with valuable contributions to make despite some of them not necessarily being into code. 

At our core, all of our members are technologists and either work or play with technology to some degree. This is a space to get technical!

But “being technical” is a loose definition. For us, it’s anyone who works on the internet or dabbles in tech. Anyone who uses computers on a daily basis and is interested in learning more is welcome. While some of us are developers by trade, we also work with folks who focus more on content, marketing or leadership. We all have something to share. 

## Best in the west:
Geographically speaking this group is focused on members who reside in the Pacific Northwest region. The core group started as a meetup in Victoria, but there are collaborators now also in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland. We’re focused on building community in the Cascadian region for now, welcome both US and Canadian citizens. 

(That said, we welcome anyone willing to join us virtually (from anywhere) as well if your values are aligned. We’re always open to bringing talent and new awareness to our doorstep.)

## Valuing diversity, equity and inclusion:
Aside from technology and loosely inhabiting the same bioregion, the third major facet of this community is welcoming and advocating for inclusive collaboration. 

We want to create welcoming environments, spaces that protect the most vulnerable, and opportunities to hear different perspectives. Our members come from a variety of backgrounds and orientations. 

So above all else, if you’re interested in helping mentor, create opportunity, or build connections, there is a space for you here.
