# Territory Acknowledgement

We would like to start by acknowledging with respect that the land on which
we gather and operate is within the traditional and unceded territories of
the Lekwungen peoples. This includes the Songhees, Esquimalt and also W̱SÁNEĆ
peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

Our words and actions have meaning and shape the world around us, which is why
it’s important to acknowledge the traditional First Nations territories on
which we gather and operate. This doesn’t imply that we believe the work of
reconciliation is done, but should serve as a baseline upon which we hope to
continually improve.

We acknowledge and thank these First Nations communities for allowing us to
live, work and play on their lands.
