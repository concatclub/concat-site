# Territory Acknowledgement

We would like to start by acknowledging with respect that the land on which we
gather is the traditional and unceded territories of the Lekwungen peoples, as
well as the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical
relationships with the land continue to this day.

Our words and actions have meaning and shape the world around us, which is why
it’s important to acknowledge the traditional first nations territories on
which we gather and operate. This doesn’t imply that we believe the work of
reconciliation is done, but should serve as a baseline upon which we hope to
continually improve.

We acknowledge and thank the Lkwungen People, also known as the Songhees and
Esquimalt First Nations communities, for allowing us to live, work and play on
their lands.
