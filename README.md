# concat.club Website

This is the repo for our base website, built with Next.js, Preact (instead of
react) and MDX for content.

## Development

Check out the code locally and run `yarn install` to pull down all of the
dependencies. Then you can run `yarn dev` to start a development server so that
changes made locally can be previewed.
